# HDrive For FRC
This package is a full implementation of an HDrive with all features WPIlib provides for their built in drive classes such as Differential Drive.

## How to Use
Place the "HDrive" folder inside of a folder called "packages" at the same level as "robot", the file path within a standard WPIlib Java framework (command & timed) should be src/main/java/frc/packages/HDrive

## Documentation
For now the only documentation is in line with intellisense integration I apologize for the lack of an official docs page that will be added soon.

## Future notes
Support for installing this as a maven package is coming soon, sorry for the inconvenience.
